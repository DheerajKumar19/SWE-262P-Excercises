Exercises in Programming Style
Comprehensive collection of well-known, and not so well-known, programming styles using a simple computational task, term frequency.
Explanations and historical context for all these styles can be found in the companion book Exercises in Programming Style.

Additions are welcome!

You can contribute:

new exercises related to the existing styles
an entirely new programming style
new names for the existing styles
discussion of names, pros and cons of each style

Please follow the conventions suggested by the existing code base, specifically, if you are contributing a new style,
make a new folder called nn-funname and add an example program in that folder called tf-nn.ext.
(nn is the next avalaible number in the collection) Additionally, add a README.md file that clearly describes the contraints for writing programs in that style.
